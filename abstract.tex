Nature Letters begin with a fully referenced ``bold paragraph" that is arguably the most important item to get your paper past the editors.   It has to be written with readers in other disciplines in mind, of length about 200 words, but certainly no more than 300 words. This paragraph starts with a 2-3 sentence basic introduction to the field; followed by a one-sentence statement of the main conclusions starting 'Here we show' or equivalent phrase; and finally, 2-3 sentences putting the main findings into general context so it is clear how the results described in the paper have moved the field forwards.  Please refer to nature's annotated example to see how the summary paragraph for a Letter should be constructed\cite{nat_boldpar}.
