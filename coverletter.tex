% In addition, a cover letter needs to be written with the
% following:
% \begin{enumerate}
%  \item A 100 word or less summary indicating on scientific grounds
% why the paper should be considered for a wide-ranging journal like
% \textsl{Nature} instead of a more narrowly focussed journal.
%  \item A 100 word or less summary aimed at a non-scientific audience,
% written at the level of a national newspaper.  It may be used for
% \textsl{Nature}'s press release or other general publicity.
%  \item The cover letter should state clearly what is included as the
% submission, including number of figures, supporting manuscripts
% and any Supplementary Information (specifying number of items and
% format).
%  \item The cover letter should also state the number of
% words of text in the paper; the number of figures and parts of
% figures (for example, 4 figures, comprising 16 separate panels in
% total); a rough estimate of the desired final size of figures in
% terms of number of pages; and a full current postal address,
% telephone and fax numbers, and current e-mail address.
% \end{enumerate}

%
