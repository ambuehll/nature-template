\begin{methods}

Methods go here. This section should not exceed 3000 words, and it cannot contain figures or tables. References in the methods section do not count towards the references limit in the main text. The references in this section should be numbered sequentially starting with the last reference in the main text. 

You can either install this template permanently in your latex path, or you can just put all the files in the same folder as the \verb!nature-template.tex! file. I recommend the latter.
