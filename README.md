nature-template
===============

A template for nature journal submissions.

The original template is found at: http://tug.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/nature/nature.cls

It, however, does not conform to the current guidelines so it needed to be updated.

This template is valid as of 10/23/2014.

Features:

- Figures go at the end of the document
- Line numbers
- Bold paragraph
- Sections in separate files
- Commenting commands to annotate todo items for work with others
- Custom figure labels for main body and extended data

The main file is nature-template.tex. Start by reading the sample output file: nature-template.pdf.

Note, there is also a template coverletter.tex that you can use as the basis for putting together the coverletter.

Good luck,

Carlos
