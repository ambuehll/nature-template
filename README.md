nature-template
===============

A template for nature journal submissions.

The original template is found at: http://tug.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/nature/nature.cls

It, however, does not conform to the current guidelines so it needed to be updated.

This template is valid as of 10/23/2014.

Features:

> Figures go at the end of the document
> Line numbers
> Bold paragraph
> Sections in separate files
> Commenting commands to annotate todo items for work with others
> Custom figure labels for main body and extended data
